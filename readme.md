# Dentalink Code Challenge
 
This is a simple challenge where you can show all your skills. There are no rules, it's absolute open to however you want to solve it. 

We also want to understand how talented are you figuring out the best possible solutions for a single problem.

##Â Schedule challenge

Index.html is a simple calendar structure (like Google Calendar) with no events rendered.

Given /js/data.json, which is already requested via AJAX in /js/app.js, render items on the corresponding day, in a way that overlapping events are re-arranged in columns.

An expected output can be found in /img/expected.png.

## How to run

From the project folder run `npm run start` and go to http://localhost:8081

## How to run on Dev mode

From the project folder run `npm run start` and go to http://localhost:8081

and in other tab/terminal listen for changes (so if you change code you see the changes on the browser)

From the project folder run `npm run dev`

## How to run tests

From the project folder run `npm run test`

You can see in the console the test results and also the test coverage.
You can also see an html version of the coverage in the coverage folder: coverage/lcov-report/index.html

## Tips
The key is not on the CSS. Each event can be an absolute positioned div.
